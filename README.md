App using previous Dodo project written in IntelliJ.

Purpose is twofold:
  1. Practice Java and Android Studio, including how to use layouts, implement interactive buttons, text, and lists, and work on UI.
  2. Explore speed factors of the extinct dodo bird and examine the differences in bipedal locomotion between the dodo and humans.
